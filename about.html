  <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At Bandera Skyworks, we specialize in delivering precision aerial
    inspection and data collection services designed to enhance safety,
    streamline operations, and reduce costs. Serving clients throughout the
    Texas Hill Country and beyond, our mission is to provide actionable insights
    through high-resolution imaging and advanced analytics—without the risk,
    time, or expense of traditional inspection methods.</p>
    
    <p>We utilize cutting-edge DJI Enterprise drones, including the Matrice 30T
    for high-precision visual and thermal inspections, and the Mavic 3 Pro.
    These platforms allow us to capture ultra-detailed data in even the most
    challenging conditions, enabling faster maintenance decisions, early fault
    detection, and real-time situational awareness across industries such as
    energy, utilities, infrastructure, construction, and agriculture.</p>


    <p>Whether you're managing powerlines, inspecting rooftops, surveying
    pipelines, or monitoring crop health, Bandera Skyworks brings a new level of
    efficiency and clarity to your operational workflow.</p>
    

  <h2>Licensed and Compliant: Flying Under FAA Part 107</h2>

  <p>All Bandera Skyworks pilots are certified under FAA Part 107, the
  regulatory framework that governs commercial drone operations in the United
  States. This certification ensures we operate legally, safely, and with the
  highest professional standards in airspace usage, flight planning, and risk
  mitigation.</p>
  
  Operating under Part 107 means:

  <ul>
    <li>We follow strict pre-flight and post-flight procedures.</li>
    <li>We maintain detailed flight and maintenance logs for compliance and
    audit readiness.</li>
    <li>We carry appropriate liability coverage for commercial UAS operations.</li>
    <li>We have the authority to fly in controlled airspace with proper FAA
    authorization, enabling us to complete jobs others may not be able to.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our commitment to Part 107 compliance reflects our dedication to safety,
  professionalism, and trust—giving our clients peace of mind that every mission
  is executed with precision and accountability.</p>
