    <h1>Our Services</h1>
    
    <h2>Aerial Inspections</h2>
    Gain detailed insight into hard-to-reach assets and critical infrastructure
    with drone inspections that reduce risk, time, and cost. Our drone platforms
    capture both visual and thermal imagery to support maintenance planning,
    safety audits, and performance evaluations with unmatched clarity and
    accuracy.
    
    <h2>Energy & Utilities</h2>
    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/utility-pole.svg" height="30"
    width="30">Powerline Inspections</h3>
    <p>Our comprehensive powerline inspection services leverage cutting-edge
    automated flight technology and high-resolution imaging systems to transform
    how utilities monitor their infrastructure. We specialize in rapidly
    identifying critical issues including electrical faults, cracked or damaged
    insulators, vegetation encroachment, and structural defects that could
    compromise grid performance. Our advanced aerial platforms follow precisely
    programmed flight paths, capturing detailed visual and thermal data along
    entire transmission and distribution corridors.</p>
    
    <p>By replacing traditional ground-based inspections with our efficient aerial
    solutions, utilities can dramatically reduce operational costs associated
    with field crew deployment and vehicle maintenance. Our technology enables
    inspection teams to cover more territory in less time, minimizing truck
    rolls while maximizing asset visibility. This proactive approach to
    infrastructure monitoring helps utilities maintain superior grid
    reliability, prevent outages before they occur, and ensure compliance with
    vegetation management regulations. The result is a safer, more resilient
    power delivery system that keeps communities connected while optimizing
    maintenance budgets and resource allocation.</p>
    
    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/transformer-bolt.svg" height="30"
    width="30">Substation Inspections</h3>
    <p>Transform your substation maintenance program with our comprehensive
    aerial inspection services that combine cutting-edge radiometric thermal
    imaging technology with ultra-high-resolution optical zoom cameras to
    deliver unprecedented visibility into your critical electrical
    infrastructure. Our specialized inspection platforms enable thorough
    evaluations of energized substations from safe distances, eliminating the
    need for personnel to enter hazardous environments or implement costly
    service interruptions that impact grid reliability and customer
    satisfaction.</p>
   
   <p>Our advanced radiometric thermal cameras provide precise, calibrated
   temperature measurements for every component within the substation, from
   power transformers and circuit breakers to bus connections and switching
   equipment. This sophisticated thermal analysis instantly reveals developing
   problems such as overheating connections caused by increased resistance,
   failing bushings, deteriorating contacts, imbalanced loads, or inadequate
   cooling systems. By capturing accurate temperature differentials and thermal
   patterns, our technology enables predictive maintenance teams to identify and
   address potential failures weeks or months before they result in catastrophic
   equipment damage or unplanned outages.</p>
   
   <p>Complementing our thermal capabilities, our high-powered optical zoom
   cameras deliver crystal-clear visual inspections that detect surface-level
   defects invisible to the naked eye from ground level. These cameras identify
   early-stage corrosion on transformer radiators, microscopic cracks in
   porcelain insulators, contamination buildup, oil staining indicating leaks,
   SF6 gas emissions, loose hardware, animal damage, and structural fatigue in
   support frameworks. The ability to conduct these detailed inspections while
   maintaining safe distances from energized equipment represents a paradigm
   shift in substation maintenance practices.</p>
   
   <p>By performing regular aerial inspections without de-energizing equipment,
   utilities maximize operational efficiency while creating comprehensive
   digital records of asset conditions over time. This data-driven approach
   supports informed decision-making, optimizes capital planning, ensures
   regulatory compliance, and ultimately delivers more reliable power to
   customers while protecting the safety of inspection personnel and maintenance
   crews.</p>

    <h2>Oil & Gas</h2>
    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/oil-well.svg" height="30"
    width="30"> Facility Inspections</h3>
    Improve operational uptime with remote inspections of refineries, tanks,
    rigs, and platforms. Our drone solutions minimize the need for scaffolding,
    ladders, or shutdowns.

    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/pipe-valve.svg" height="30"
    width="30"> Pipeline Monitoring</h3>
    Cover hundreds of miles of pipeline efficiently. We detect corrosion, leaks,
    right-of-way violations, and erosionâ€”all while enhancing environmental
    compliance and lowering inspection costs.

    <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/solar-panel.svg" height="30"
    width="30"> Solar Farm Inspections</h3>
    Maximize energy production by identifying defective panels, soiling, or
    connection issues. Our thermal-equipped drones can quickly scan entire solar
    arrays for faults.

    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/wind-turbine.svg" height="30"
    width="30">Wind Turbine Inspections</h3>
    Inspect blades, towers, and nacelles without manual climbing. We capture
    detailed images of cracks, lightning strikes, and surface erosion, reducing
    turbine downtime and improving safety.

    <h2>Infrastructure & Construction</h2>
    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/bridge.svg" height="30"
    width="30"> Bridge Inspections</h3>
    Assess aging or damaged bridges with detailed aerial surveys. Our drones
    access hard-to-reach areas and provide structural insights without requiring
    lane closures or heavy equipment.

    <h3><img src="./fontawesome/svgs/people-roof.svg" height="30"
    width="30"> Roof Inspections</h3>
    Get comprehensive data on roof conditions using thermal and RGB sensors.
    Whether for storm damage, insurance claims, or routine maintenance, our
    reports offer clear, actionable insights.
